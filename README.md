Coursera Datascience Getting &amp; Cleaning Data Course project

J. Gregory Hall

This project is based http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The goal is to describe the dataset's averages and stddev's for each subject and activity and present this in a single readable data table.

For each record it is provided:

- A 86-feature vector with averages of the original "mean" time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:

- 'README.txt': here you are

- 'codebook.txt': yes it is!

- 'features_info.txt': The original dataset's codebook

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'summaryAveStddev.csv': the resulting table from run_analysis.R

- 'run_analysis.R': script which downloads original dataset and then produces the summary descriptive table
